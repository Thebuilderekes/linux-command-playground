# The Linux Command line Notes

- Symbolic links can be used for both files and folders but hard links can 
only work for files

- You can create your alias to do combined commands in a sequence like
this 
```alias <alias name> ="<enter your combined command>"```

but you must first check if your alias name is not already a builtin shell
command  by using "type <your alias>"

- You can use `tldr` command  to get a summarised effect of using `man` command

- You can use 2> to output an error into another file
e.g ```ls -l /bi/<non-existent command that causes error> 2> output.txt```

- DO NOT TRY TO CAT 2 COMMANDS TOGETHER, COMPUTER MIGHT BREAK

- when using pipe to `sort` command for doing `ls` of two files, the list is joined into one single
sorted  list
e.g ``ls /pathtofile1.txt /pathtofile2.txt | sort``` will give one joined list that is sorted

Linux allows for a multi user system through ssh. To maintain this, permissions had to be made to
control this multi user access.

●id – Display user identity
●chmod – Change a file's mode
●umask – Set the default file permissions
●su – Run a shell as another user
●sudo – Execute a command as another user
●chown – Change a file's owner
●chgrp – Change a file's group ownership
●passwd – Change a user's password

-*important* use `id` command to know your id

## file mode in binary and octal

1    001       --x <br>
2    010       -w- <br>
3    011       -wx <br>
4    100       r-- <br>
5    101       r-x  <br>
6    110       rw  <br>
7    111       rwx <br>

Notation          Meaning
u+x              Add execute permission for the owner.

u-x              Remove execute permission from the owner.

+x               Add execute permission for the owner, group, and world. This is
                 equivalent to a+x.

o-rw             Remove the read and write permissions from anyone besides the
                 owner and group owner.

go=rw            Set the group owner and anyone besides the owner to have read and 
                 write permission. If either the group owner or the world previously
                 had execute permission, it is removed.

u+x,go=rx        Add execute permission for the owner and set the permissions for 
                 the group and others to read and 


find out about ``umask``


``chown`` command to changer file ownership
``chgrp`` command to change group ownership

## Processes
- Shell scripts are located in the /etc folder.

- Daemons are programs that run in the background

*Processes in chapter  contains deeper concepts about processes that should be looked at*
*later along the linux leaning journey *


## The environment

The environment is the body of information that is maintained by the shell.
It contaiins 2 types of data namely:
- The shell variables - This is data paced there by bash
- The enviroment variables - everything else


Use ```printenv | less`` to see what is stored in the enviroment

### Things you must remember:

**The startup files for the login shell sessions** - when we are propmted for username and password
**The startup files for non login shell sessions**  - When we launch the terminal
