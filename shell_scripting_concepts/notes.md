## ZSH FEATURES

Zsh handles arrays differently, and array indices start at 1.


## Positional arguments
 $1 and $2 are positional arguments. They are used to signify the position of where you would
like any parameter that you are passing to be stored.

## Test operator - read up
exit code 0 means that a command was executed without any issues.
